# hello-world
My name is Justin Bagley. I am an evolutionary biologist interested in the ecology, evolution, and biogeography of Neotropical and temperate freshwater fishes and lizards. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral research fellow studying the historical to recent geological and climatic mechanisms underlying the diversity and distributions of species in the Cerrado biome in Central Brazil.

My first GitHub repository is a classic "Hello World" one.
